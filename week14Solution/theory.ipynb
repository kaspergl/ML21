    "## Ex3: Analyzing Feature Hashing\n",
    "In feature hashing, we map a vector $x \\in R^d$ to a vector in $R^k$ using two hash functions $h : [d] \\to [k]$ and $g : [d] \\to \\{-1,1\\}$. The hash functions are chosen randomly and independently before seeing any data. Assume the hash functions satisfy the following two properties:\n",
    "1. For any two distinct coordinates $i \\neq j$, we have that $g(i)$ and $g(j)$ are independent and uniform random, i.e. for any $a,b \\in \\{-1,1\\}$ it holds that $\\Pr_g[g(i)=a \\wedge g(j)=b] = 1/4$.\n",
    "2. For any two distinct coordinates $i \\neq j$, we have that $\\Pr_h[h(i)=h(j)] \\leq 1/k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding $f(x)$ of a vector $x$ is obtained by hashing each index $i \\in [d]$ to the index $h(i)$ and adding $g(i) \\cdot x_i$ to $f(x)_{h(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task it to prove:\n",
    "1. For two vectors $x,y$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[f(x)^\\intercal f(y)] = x^\\intercal y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The following re-writing may be useful:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x)^\\intercal f(y) = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d 1_{[h(i)=h(j)]} x_i y_j g(i) g(j),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $1_{[h(i)=h(j)]}$ is the indicator random variable taking the value $1$ if $h(i)=h(j)$ and $0$ otherwise.\n",
    "You may also need linearity of expectation $\\mathbb{E}[A + B] = \\mathbb{E}[A] + \\mathbb{E}[B]$ and that for independent random variables $X,Y$ we have $\\mathbb{E}[XY] = \\mathbb{E}[X]\\mathbb{E}[Y]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BEGIN MATH SOLUTION\n",
    "1. Using the hint and linearity of expectation, we see that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[f(x)^\\intercal f(y)] = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\sum_{j=1}^d \\mathbb{E}[1_{[h(i)=h(j)]} x_i y_j g(i) g(j)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Using that $h$ and $g$ are chosen independently and that $g(i)$ is independent of $g(j)$ when $i \\neq j$, it holds for any term with $i \\neq j$ that $\\mathbb{E}[1_{[h(i)=h(j)]} x_i y_j g(i) g(j)] = \\mathbb{E}[1_{[h(i)=h(j)]}] x_i y_j \\mathbb{E}[g(i)] \\mathbb{E}[g(j)]$. Since $g(i)$ is uniform random among $\\{-1,1\\}$, its expectation is $0$ and the whole term is $0$. Therefore we have\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[f(x)^\\intercal f(y)] = \\sum_{i=1}^d \\mathbb{E}[1_{[h(i)=h(i)]} x_i y_j g(i)^2]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The indicator $1_{[h(i)=h(i)]}$ is always $1$ and $g(i)^2$ is also $1$. Hence\n",
    "$$\n",

Now consider the dichotomy that contains all points on the boundary of the bounding box but none of the points inside. That dichotomy is impossible if the box $B$ has a point in its interior. Finally, if all 5 points lie on the boundary of the bounding box, there are two that lie on the same side of the bounding box. Any dichotomy involving all but one of those two is impossible.\n",
